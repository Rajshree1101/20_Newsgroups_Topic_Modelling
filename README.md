# 20_Newsgroups_Topic_Modelling
I successfully conducted a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) project using the News 20 dataset. My work involved understanding the core concepts of topic modeling and applying them practically. I meticulously preprocessed the data using various techniques such as regular expressions and lemmatization. By integrating advanced features like Phrases and Phraser from Gensim, I enhanced the model's accuracy in identifying relevant phrases within the text. Through rigorous optimization using coherence scores of 0.999 , I determined the optimal number of topics, ensuring the extraction of meaningful insights. I visualized the results effectively using Matplotlib, making the data actionable. 
This project showcased my expertise in Python, NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and Gensim, highlighting my ability to handle complex NLP tasks and deliver impactful outcomes.
